## Timely - an Automated Calendar Scheduler
Timely is an application designed to simplify your calendar.

 - Do you know what you want to do, but don't care exactly when you do it? Create a ***Flexible Event*** (e.g. "I want to practice piano for 30 mins, any time between 6pm-11pm tonight")
 - Know exaclty when you're doing something? Create a ***Fixed Event*** (e.g. "I'm getting dinner with my friend from 6pm-8pm tomorrow")

Timely will automatically reschedule all your flexible events around your fixed ones to minimise clashes, and it can even integrate with your Google Calendar!

**PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS - NO FINISHED PRODUCT IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. STAY TUNED FOR MORE...**
